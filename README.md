# AutomataTester

## Overview
AutomataTester is a Python project designed to define and test Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). The project allows users to create their own automata and test them against various input strings, facilitating an understanding of finite state machines and automata theory.

## Features
- Define DFAs and NFAs with customizable states and transitions.
- Test input strings against the defined automata.
- Provides clear feedback on whether each input string is accepted or rejected.
